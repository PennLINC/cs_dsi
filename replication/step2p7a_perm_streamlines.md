Step 2.7a permutation tests for streamlines

# step 1. Get dice score
- main script: `code/get_dice_scores.py`
    - I copied it as `_replication.py` where I changed the output dir
- very quick
- checks:
    - csv file should be identical with Hamsi's
    - the structure of csv file table should make sense
        - covering subjects, sessions, acq (for cs-dsi), etc
